<span class="markdown">This vocabulary represent the information on the "Budget and budget execution" according to the data from municipal economic management. The municipal budget describes how public money is managed during one year. In the Spanish territory the structure of the municipal budget is equal for all municipalities and has been legally defined in the Order EHA/3565/2008, from December 3 (https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2008-19916), which approved the structure of the local entities budget. Basically, the budget is divided into Income, that is from where money comes and in which way, and in Expenses, which refers to how the entity will use this money.

With respect to Expenses, the quantities that appear in this budget are denoted as Budget Credits and are ordered according to three classifications: organic, by expense program and economic. The organic classification refers to who makes the expense. This classification is considered optional for local entities. The classification by expense program informs in what the money is spent on, that is the purpose of the expense. Finally, the ecconomic classification informs on how it is spent, that is the economic nature of the expense. The combination of these three classification forms the budget line or budget item. With the purpose of having a record on how the expense budget has been executed by a local entity, there is the Statement of Liquidation of the Expense Budget. This statement provides information on how much has been spent during the year, in what this year´s resources have been spent on, and who has made this expense.
    
With respect to Income, the quantities thar appear in this budget are those that are planned or estimated to obtain in the year in order to finance the expense budget. The values that appear in the income budget are called Income Budget Estimates. These estimates are ordered acccording to two classifciations: economic and organic. The economic classification presents the information according to the economic nature of the budgetary rights. The organic classification is optional and informs about who enters the money and is a classification according to the specific organizational structure of the local entity. To have a record on how the income budget has been executed there is the Statement of Liquidation of the Income Budget. This statement contains the necessary information to know the amount of resources that have been obtained in one year by the local enity, and where these resources come from.   
    
The economic classification of expenses and income and the classification by expense programs, are described in the "Orden del Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas HAP/419/2014" (https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2014-2922).

Finally, to inform how the budget has been executed there is the Statement of Liquidation of the Budget. This statement is comprised by the statements of liquidation of expenses and income described previously, and the budget result. The budget result is obtained from the difference between the net liquidated budgetary rights and the recognized duties in the exercise. Thus, it reflects the superavit/deficit in the exercise.
